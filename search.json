Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April 2010 as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.",

These hiPSC lines were differentiated into hiPSC-CMs using a 2D monolayer differentiation protocol and were maintained in a 5% CO2/air environment as previously described (Lian et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012)     Monolayers of beating hiPSC-CMs were sent to the ISS for 5.5 weeks. The hiPSC-CMs were grown in fully enclosed 6-well plates (BioCells) optimized for long-term microgravity cell culture. BioCells were launched to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Dragon transport spacecraft via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the SpaceX CRS-9 commercial resupply service mission. BioCells were maintained aboard the ISS in an on-station incubator (Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory [SABL]) at 37C and 5% CO2 and ground control cells were cultured in parallel. The hiPSC-CMs within the BioCells were cultured in a high-nutrient CM maintenance medium that was changed weekly. Ground control hiPSC-CMs were maintained identically with media changes replicated exactly on a 6-h delay from the ISS.     We analyzed the transcriptome of hiPSC-CMs during spaceflight and post-flight. hiPSC-CMs were harvested at 4.5weeks in spaceflight and on day 10 after return to Earth. Ground hiPSC-CMs were collected at the post-return time point as controls. RNALater (Thermo Fisher) was used to preserve flight samples designated for downstream RNA-sequencing analysis.      Samples preserved in RNALater were stored at 4C until return to our laboratory when RNA was isolated from preserved wells in the BioCells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer  s protocol. DNase treatment was performed using RNase-free DNase kit (Qiagen). All RNA samples had RNA integrity number equal or higher than 8.9 and concentration equal or higher than 48 ng/uL (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer).     Library prep was performed by BGI using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit.     Sequencing was performed by BGI with 30-40 million paired-end 100bp reads per sample on the Illumina HiSeq platform.     Raw reads were aligned by HISAT2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)(Kim et al. 2015) to human genome (hg38).",

We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression structure and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling.

                        "Study Protocol Description": "Shenzhou-8 was launched in the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on 1 November 2011. About 10 h before the launch, fresh solid NGM and approximately 100,000 dauer worms were successively loaded in the containers.Containers were settled into the centrifugal and static slots of BIOBOX. The Shenzhou-8 mission was flown from 1 - 17 November 2011, with a total mission time of 16.5 days. Throughout the duration of the experiment, the containers maintained a temperature of 23+/- 0.5C. G-force peaks did not exceed levels of 0.01 g, while most of the time values oscillated between 0.005 g. Space radiations dose was measured in the static slot (1.92 mGy) and centrifuge slot (2.27 mGy), respectively. Seven hours after landing, worms were collected and kept in liquid nitrogen. The corresponding ground controls of the experiment were performed in parallel at the Payload Integration Test Center in Beijing 2 days later. Here, the samples were kept in a static slot in BIOBOX and temperature was maintained at 23 +/-0.5C. The ground group was stopped after 16.5 days and the samples were collected after 7 h later. Worms were cultured on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) at 23C and synchronized to dauer larvae by 1% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) (Sangon Biotec, Shanghai, China) according to the protocols in Wormbook (Stiernagle 2006).     Total RNA was isolated using Invitrogen TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Wilmington, DE, USA) and RNA quality monitored by GelDoc-ItTM 310 Imaging System (UVP, Cambridge, CA, EUA).     For Cy3 labeling of cDNA, the NimbleGen One-Color DNA labeling kit was used according to the manufacturer's guideline detailed in the Gene Expression Analysis protocol (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).     Microarrays were hybridized at 42C during 16 to 20h with 4 ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA in NimbleGen hybridization buffer/ hybridization component A in a hybridization chamber (Hybridization System - NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Following hybridization, washing was performed using the NimbleGen Wash Buffer kit (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).     Slides were scanned at 5 um/pixel resolution using an Axon GenePix 4000 B scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation) piloted by GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon).     Scanned images (TIFF format) were imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for grid alignment and expression data analysis. Expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm included in the NimbleScan software.",

                        "Study Protocol Description": "Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 with GCOS software according to manufactuer  s protocol (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual)     Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Hybridization protocol (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual)     Qiagen RNeasy Kit     Affymetrix One Cycle Target Labeling according to manufacturer  s protocol (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual)     Probe set summarization and normalization was performed by robust multi-array averaging (RMA including background subtraction summarization by median polish and quantile normalization) using the R/Bioconductor package affy.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle where the payload was located. More specifically we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1 DLOC2 and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was  xe2 x80 x9cliving xef xbf xbd?. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Flies for both the flight and the ground control experiments were transferred from fresh cultures to fly kits 24 hours in advance of the onset of the experiment. Each fly kit consisted of a polycarbonate fly cassette with a 2 ml food tray held in a ventilated aluminum container. These kits were originally developed by the European Space Agency and used previously for Drosophila experiments in space and were subsequently modified by us for use in this experiment. Ten virgin females and 5 males were housed in each fly cassette. Ten kits (5 with flies and 5 empty) flew on the space shuttle and 10 remained on the ground. The fly kits were placed in stowage foam on the shuttle middeck at ambient temperature and in total darkness. The identical procedure was followed for the ground control flies. For both ground and flight experiments on day 6 the food trays containing eggs and larvae were transferred to the 5 empty cassettes and fresh food was given to the original flies. The temperature and relative humidity in the spaceflight and ground payloads were monitored minute-by-minute using a HOBO data logger (Onset Computer Corporation). Values were tracked in real time and paralleled for the ground control in the OES (Orbital Environmental Simulator) at the Kennedy Space Center. Environmental data from flight and ground experiments were provided by the operations team as part of the routine shuttle flight logistics. The average temperature on the flight deck was 23.5 xc2 xb0C ranging between 21.71 xc2 xb0C and 25.56 xc2 xb0C. The ground control average temperature was 22.5 xc2 xb0C with a minimum of 19.42 xc2 xb0C and a maximum of 25.56 xc2 xb0C. The relative humidity was 27.2% on the shuttle deck and 25.4% on ground.     The Drosophila melanogaster Gal4-UAS transgenic line expressing two copies of eGFP under the control of the hemolectin promoter was used in all experiments. This line expresses GFP in all plasmatocytes and has no other phenotype. Flies were grown on semi-defined medium (1% agar 4% brewer  s yeast 2% yeast extract 2% peptone 3% sucrose 6% glucose 0.05% MgSO4 0.05% CaCl2 and tegosept) to which 0.5% blue food dye was added to facilitate the recognition of late 3rd instar larvae at wandering stage by the absence of colored food in the gut.     Larval RNA for microarrays was prepared from 6 sets of 50 mid 3rd instar larvae reared in microgravity and collected on the day of landing of the space shuttle and the same number of control larvae raised on ground. The space shuttle flight had a total duration of 12 days and 18.5 hours. Adult RNA was prepared from 3 sets of 20 adult females each that emerged during the flight and within 4 hours of landing (Flight Day 1) and from adult females from the corresponding ground control cassettes (Ground Day 1). The original parental flies were removed. Given the known generation time at 24 xc2 xb0C the adults that emerged in space (F1) would have been no more than 2 days old.     Raw .CEL files were read in and normalized using the r script  affyNormQC.R  which utilizes the RMA algorithm through the oligo R package [rma() with default parameters]. Quality control reports were generated via the r script  affyNormQC.R  with parameter  do.logtransform  set to TRUE for the generating the raw report. This microarray experiment was annotated with the r script  annotateProbes.R  which utilized Annotation-Db class probe annotations specific to each chip from the Bioconductor repository. In cases where multiple probes mapped to the same gene ID representative probes were selected with the highest mean normalized intensity across all samples.",

The goal was to validate the Drosophila model for understanding alterations of innate immune responses in humans due to spaceflight. Five containers of flies with ten female and five male fruit flies in each container were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours with a new generation reared in microgravity. RNA was extracted on the day of shuttle landing from whole body animals (3rd instar larvae and adults) hybridized to Drosophila 2.0 Affymetrix genome arrays and the expression level of all genes was normalized against the gene expression level from the corresponding developmental stage animals raised on ground. Spaceflight altered the expression of larval genes involved in the maturation of plasmatocytes (macrophages) and their phagocytic response as well as the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria and of lysozymes antimicrobial peptide pathway and immune stress genes hallmarks of humoral immunity. Larval microarrays (FL 6 samples) are based on RNA extracted from 6 independent sets of 50 mid 3rd instar larvae reared in microgravity and collected on the day of landing after 12 days and 18.5 hours on the space shuttle and the same number of control larvae raised on ground (GL 6 samples). Adults microarrays (F1 3 samples) are based on RNA from 3 sets of 20 adult females each that emerged during spaceflight and within 4 hours of landing and the same number of adult females from the corresponding ground control containers (G1 3 samples).",
